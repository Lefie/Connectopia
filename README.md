# Final Project : Connectopia

## Overview

LinkedIn is the main platform for people to connect with professionals, reach out to recruiters, and eventually land a job. It can be daunting to present oneself professionally to the world, and at times it may feel as though our values and worth are based solely on our professional achievements and job titles.

Connectopia seeks to help users find creative ways to present themselves beyond their professional lives. Not only can users find job and volunteer opportunities on this platform based on their personal interests, but they can also network with others either individually or in group settings. Connectopia allows users to showcase aspects of their lives that are not strictly professional. It encourages personal growth and impactful collaboration with others. In conclusion, Connectopia is a platform where both professional relationships and friendships can be formed.
